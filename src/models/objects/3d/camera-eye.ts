     *   - Input: world-space point (p) and the current viewport aspect ratio.

     *       ¬±1 on X = left/right edges (after aspect ratio correction)
     *
     * Steps:
     *   1. Translate the point so the camera position becomes the origin.
     *   2. Ignore points with z <= 0 (behind or at the camera).
     *   3. Apply perspective division:
     *        - Scale X and Y by distance from camera (cz) and by focal length factor.
     *        - Focal length factor is derived from vertical field of view:
     *            t = tan(fovY / 2)
     *        - Horizontal coordinate is divided by aspect ratio to keep proportions.
     *   4. Return normalized coordinates.
     *
     * These normalized coordinates are later mapped to pixel space
     * by ScreenSpace.toPixels().
